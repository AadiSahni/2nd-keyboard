; here lies the ahk part of what you will need for a second keyboard, and by that I mean a second keyboard that functions different, so one that doesn't type like the first one. 
; for this to work you must wrap all the keys in F24, a function key that exists virtually, but not physically on keyboards, which is fantastic for ahk.
; for iCUE that is a Corsair keyboard, you need to import a custom profile that sets all keys to macro that sends F24 and then the key that you pressed, so like F24 down, a down, a up, F24 up. 
; for qmk you do the same thing except it's way more complicated than import a profile, there's a tutorial on it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZEoss4XIgc
