	; so the idea is that you presss a hotkey for activating leaderKey, and then press any other key or key combination, for example v, or v with any modifier like shift v and then it executes code based on what you pressed while inside leaderKey. Maybe I can wrap the key in F21 and have it corelate with an action the the assignments script kinda like how the second keyboard is done(each key is wrapped in F24, so it becomes F24 + a instead of just regular a)
	; for now the plan is dead, and I also don't have any keys left for assigning since the capslock layer is finished. 8, 9 and 0 are left, but they are reserved for Instant app Switcher, and the keys are too far right anyway, making it impossible to activate with one hand. P is also empty but again, same thing, too far right, hard to use regularly
